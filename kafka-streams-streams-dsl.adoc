== High-Level Streams DSL

Kafka Streams offers *Streams DSL* with high-level data stream abstractions for streams and tables, and to define a stream processing topology.

Streams DSL includes:

* <<kafka-streams-StreamsBuilder.adoc#, StreamsBuilder>> for defining a topology

* <<kafka-streams-KStream.adoc#, KStream>> for working with record streams

* <<kafka-streams-KTable.adoc#, KTable>> for working with changelog streams

* <<kafka-streams-GlobalKTable.adoc#, GlobalKTable>> for working with global changelog streams

Streams DSL also includes the following for streaming aggregations and joins:

* <<kafka-streams-KGroupedStream.adoc#, KGroupedStream>>

* <<kafka-streams-KGroupedTable.adoc#, KGroupedTable>>

Streams DSL is designed for Java developers primarily, but also offers <<kafka-streams-scala.adoc#, Scala API for Kafka Streams>> for Scala developers.
