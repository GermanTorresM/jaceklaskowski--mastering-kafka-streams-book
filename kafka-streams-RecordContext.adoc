== [[RecordContext]] RecordContext -- Record Metadata

`RecordContext` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<implementations, record contexts>> that Kafka Streams developers use for *dynamic routing of output records* (using <<kafka-streams-TopicNameExtractor.adoc#, TopicNameExtractor>>) based on the metadata of a record, i.e. <<headers, headers>>, <<offset, offset>>, <<partition, partition>>, <<timestamp, timestamp>>, and <<topic, topic>>.

[[implementations]]
NOTE: <<kafka-streams-internals-ProcessorRecordContext.adoc#, ProcessorRecordContext>> is the default implementation of the <<contract, RecordContext Contract>> in Kafka Streams.
