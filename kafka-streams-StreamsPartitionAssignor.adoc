== [[StreamsPartitionAssignor]] StreamsPartitionAssignor -- Partition Assignment Strategy

`StreamsPartitionAssignor` is a Kafka Consumer `PartitionAssignor` for a dynamic partition assignment strategy and distribute partition ownership across the members of a consumer group.

TIP: Read https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Client-side+Assignment+Proposal[Kafka Client-side Assignment Proposal] on the group management in Apache Kafka's Consumer API.

[[creating-instance]]
`StreamsPartitionAssignor` is a Kafka `Configurable` that is instantiated by reflection and <<configure, takes configuration parameters>>.

`StreamsPartitionAssignor` is registered when `StreamsConfig` is requested for the link:kafka-streams-StreamsConfig.adoc#getMainConsumerConfigs[configuration for a Kafka Consumer] with `partition.assignment.strategy` (`ConsumerConfig.PARTITION_ASSIGNMENT_STRATEGY_CONFIG`) property.

[[logPrefix]]
`StreamsPartitionAssignor` uses *stream-thread [client.id]* for the `logPrefix`.

| internalTopicManager

| userEndPoint
| [[userEndPoint]] User-defined endpoint in the format of `host:port` as <<configure, configured>> by link:kafka-streams-properties.adoc#application.server[application.server] configuration property (default: empty).

Used when `StreamsPartitionAssignor` is requested to <<subscription, subscription>> (and create a `SubscriptionInfo`)

[[logging]]
[TIP]
====
Enable `DEBUG` logging level for `org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.internals.StreamsPartitionAssignor` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.internals.StreamsPartitionAssignor=DEBUG
```

Refer to link:kafka-logging.adoc#log4j.properties[Application Logging Using log4j].

=== [[subscription]] `subscription` Method

[source, java]
----
Subscription subscription(Set<String> topics)
----

NOTE: `subscription` is part of Kafka Consumer's `PartitionAssignor` contract to...FIXME.

`subscription`...FIXME

=== [[onAssignment]] Handling Partition Assignment From Group Leader -- `onAssignment` Method

[source, java]
----
void onAssignment(Assignment assignment)
----

[NOTE]
====
`onAssignment` is part of Kafka Consumer's `PartitionAssignor` contract for a group member to handle assignment from the leader.

`onAssignment` is executed when a group member has successfully joined a group.
====

.StreamsPartitionAssignor.onAssignment
image::images/kafka-streams-StreamsPartitionAssignor-onAssignment.png[align="center"]

`onAssignment` takes the partitions (from the input `assignment`) and sorts it by topic and partition.

`onAssignment` requests `AssignmentInfo` to link:kafka-streams-internals-AssignmentInfo.adoc#decode[decode] the additional metadata (i.e. the `userData` from the input `assignment`).

CAUTION: FIXME Finish me

In the end, `onAssignment` requests the <<taskManager, TaskManager>> for the following:

. <<kafka-streams-TaskManager.adoc#setClusterMetadata, Setting cluster metadata>>

. <<kafka-streams-TaskManager.adoc#setPartitionsByHostState, Notifying StreamsMetadataState about Cluster Metadata Changes>>

. <<kafka-streams-TaskManager.adoc#setAssignmentMetadata, Setting assigned metadata>> with active and standby tasks

. <<kafka-streams-TaskManager.adoc#updateSubscriptionsFromAssignment, updateSubscriptionsFromAssignment>> with the assigned partitions

`onAssignment` reports an `TaskAssignmentException` if the numbers of partitions and active tasks are not equal.

```
Number of assigned partitions [partitions] is not equal to the number of active taskIds [activeTasks], assignmentInfo=[info]
```

=== [[configure]] Configuring Partition Assignor -- `configure` Method

[source, scala]
----
void configure(final Map<String, ?> configs)
----

NOTE: `configure` is part of Kafka Consumer's `Configurable` contract for classes that are instantiated by reflection and need to take configuration parameters.

`configure`...FIXME

=== [[prepareTopic]] `prepareTopic` Internal Method

[source, java]
----
void prepareTopic(final Map<String, InternalTopicMetadata> topicPartitions)
----

`prepareTopic`...FIXME

NOTE: `prepareTopic` is used exclusively when `StreamsPartitionAssignor` is requested to <<assign, perform group assignment>>.

=== [[assign]] Performing Group Assignment -- `assign` Method

[source, java]
----
Map<String, Assignment> assign(
  Cluster metadata,
  Map<String, Subscription> subscriptions)
----

NOTE: `assign` is part of Kafka Consumer's `PartitionAssignor` contract to perform *group assignment* given the member subscriptions and current cluster metadata.

`assign` takes consumer IDs with subscriptions (from `subscriptions`).

`assign` requests `SubscriptionInfo` to link:kafka-streams-internals-SubscriptionInfo.adoc#decode[decode] the user data of the subscription (aka _metadata_) and makes sure that the version is supported, i.e. up to 2 currently.

`assign` finds the client metadata (by the process ID) and creates one if not available.

`assign` requests the `ClientMetadata` to link:kafka-streams-internals-ClientMetadata.adoc#addConsumer[addConsumer].

`assign` prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs:

```
Constructed client metadata [clientsMetadata] from the member subscriptions.
```

CAUTION: FIXME

`assign` reports a `IllegalStateException` when the subscription version is unsupported.

```
Unknown metadata version: [usedVersion]; latest supported version: " + SubscriptionInfo.LATEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION
```
