== Stateful Stream Processing

*Stateful Stream Processing* is...FIXME

NOTE: A `StateStore` can be *local* or *global* (although it is a property of a <<kafka-streams-internals-ProcessorTopology.adoc#, ProcessorTopology>>).

Kafka Streams developers use <<kafka-streams-Stores.adoc#, Stores>> utility for creating state stores.

NOTE: A `StateStore` can be backed by a changelog topic in the Kafka cluster for fault-tolerance, i.e. with logging enabled (although it is an implementation detail, and not part of the `StateStore` contract). Kafka Streams developers use <<kafka-streams-Materialized.adoc#, Materialized>> or <<kafka-streams-StoreBuilder.adoc#, StoreBuilder>> APIs to control logging.

NOTE: A `StateStore` can be cached for performance, i.e. with caching enabled (although it is an implementation detail, and not part of the `StateStore` contract). Kafka Streams developers use <<kafka-streams-Materialized.adoc#, Materialized>> or <<kafka-streams-StoreBuilder.adoc#, StoreBuilder>> APIs to control logging.
