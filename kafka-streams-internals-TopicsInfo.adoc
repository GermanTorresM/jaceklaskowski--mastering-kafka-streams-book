== [[TopicsInfo]] TopicsInfo

[[creating-instance]]
`TopicsInfo` is a simple "container" with the following:

* [[sinkTopics]] Names of the sink topics
* [[sourceTopics]] Names of the source topics
* [[repartitionSourceTopics]] `Map<String, InternalTopicConfig>`
* [[stateChangelogTopics]] `Map<String, InternalTopicConfig>`

`TopicsInfo` is <<creating-instance, created>> exclusively when `InternalTopologyBuilder` is requested for the <<kafka-streams-internals-InternalTopologyBuilder.adoc#topicGroups, topic groups>> (when a node group has at least one source topic, incl. repartition or state changelog topics).
