void punctuate(

`punctuate` is used exclusively when `PunctuationQueue` is requested to <<kafka-streams-PunctuationQueue.adoc#mayPunctuate, attempt to punctuate>> (for `StreamTask` that attempts to punctuate by <<kafka-streams-internals-StreamTask.adoc#maybePunctuateStreamTime, stream>> and <<kafka-streams-internals-StreamTask.adoc#maybePunctuateSystemTime, system>> time).

NOTE: <<kafka-streams-internals-StreamTask.adoc#, StreamTask>> is the default and only known implementation of the <<contract, ProcessorNodePunctuator Contract>> in Kafka Streams.
